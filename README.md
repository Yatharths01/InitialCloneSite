# InitialCloneSite
This is my first site which I made while learning Basic FrontEnd and which can work as a business site. I've used only HTML and CSS to make it responsive and design it using different basic tags of HTML. It include basic Navbar and different intriguing use of buttons and references to external site. I've used media query to make it responsive.
